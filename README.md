# LeaguePlayerStats-AndroidApp
League of Legends Player Statistics and Performance Analysis as Android Application using Riot Games' API

## Description

This is an app I made using Android Studio for a class project. It uses the Riot Games API to get player data from the popular MOBA game, League of Legends.
Currently, I don't have plans to futher expand on this project. I may revisit the idea of making a League of Legends player tracking application, as a webapplication or a different medium. Currently, I'm focusing my efforts on pursuing data science as opposed to app development. 
Unfortunately, the video footage I had of the application was corrupted and the API key is no longer valid, so I'm unable to further showcase my efforts on this repository.
